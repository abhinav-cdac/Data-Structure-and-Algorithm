2. Write a linear search algorithm to return index of last occurance of key.
Ans:- 
    1. take key from user/decide the key
    2. traverse the array from n-1 to 0 (where n = size of array)
    3. compare the key with respective array elements
    4. if found return the index 
    5. if not found return -1
    
    
    
    
  i=>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    {1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,7}
    key = 5 
    output = 5
    key = 7
    output = 8
